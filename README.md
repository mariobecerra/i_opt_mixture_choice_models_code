Code for (yet to be published) paper *Bayesian I-optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures* by [Mario Becerra](http://mariobecerra.github.io/) and [Peter Goos](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00006560).

R package [opdesmixr](https://github.com/mariobecerra/opdesmixr) must be installed to run the code. Further instructions will be added to this README in the near future.

To ensure exact reproducibility, make sure to install the same version of the opdesmixr package that was used to run this code and get the results of the paper:
`devtools::install_github("mariobecerra/opdesmixr", ref = "777e67ffdd406c3b7a21952313e9aeb815cb4174")`
