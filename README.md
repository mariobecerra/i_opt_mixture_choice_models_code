Code for (yet to be published) paper *Bayesian I-optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures* by [Mario Becerra](http://mariobecerra.github.io/) and [Peter Goos](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00006560).

Work in progress.

R package [opdesmixr](https://github.com/mariobecerra/opdesmixr) must be installed to run the code. Further instructions will be added to this README in the near future.
